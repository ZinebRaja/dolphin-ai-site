            <h1>We fix the data problem that holds procurement back</h1>
            <p>
              Dolphin AI was built by procurement practitioners who got tired of seeing multi-million dollar
              sourcing decisions made on unreliable, unclassified spend data. We built the platform
              we always wished existed.

              <div className="section-rule" style={{ margin: '1rem 0 1.25rem' }} />
              <p>
                In procurement transformation after transformation, the same problem appeared at the start
                of every engagement: the spend data was a mess. Supplier names duplicated dozens of times,
                transactions mapped to the wrong categories, descriptions copied from outdated ERP fields.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
                Teams were spending weeks manually cleaning Excel files before they could even start analysis.
                And after all that effort, the data still wasn't trustworthy enough for confident strategic decisions.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
                Dolphin AI was founded to automate exactly that work — giving procurement and finance teams
                clean, classified, normalized spend data from day one, so they can spend their time on strategy
                instead of spreadsheets.
